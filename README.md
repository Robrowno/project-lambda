# Battle of Thermopylae Website - Project Lambda

Project Lambda is an informative history website focusing on the Battle of Thermopylae in 480BC.

The target audience for this website will be those looking to broaden there knowledge on Ancient Greek, or more specifically, Spartan history. 

My goal with this website is to engage with this target audience and anyone who will be interested in learning about the battle having heard of it in history lessons or films/documentaries, and want to learn more.

## Concept across different platforms

## My wireframe

I came up with my first wireframe and concept using the Balsamiq Wireframes Application that was suggested by Code Institute. 
This helped me to visualise my ideas and got me to think about how I might implement and style them. 

Using Balsamiq, I came up with three mediums for the website. A desktop, Tablet and Mobile rendering:

## Features

* Navigation Bar
    - A responsive Navigational Header that allows the user to return to the top of the page by clicking the H1 Title or to quickly find segments of the website they wish to jump to. 
    - There are 3 options: Battle, Legacy and Socials. The Battle link takes the user to the 3 day battle section of the page. The Legacy link allows the user to jump to the aftermath of the battle to see how the battle has influenced history. The Socials link takes the user to the footer of the website to access the social media icons and follow the developer on any of those platforms. 
    - When the user hovers over the links, they underline to add a bit more functionality to the bar and to confirm to the user that the links to respond to taske them where they want to go.

* Hero Image 
    - A hero image of a picture depicting the battle at the top of the page between the header and the About section. Designed to draw the user in to find out more about thew battle.

* About Section 
    - An About section describes the aim of my website to the reader between two hr lines. It's deisgned to brieftly take the reader's attention away to tell them why I made this website and what my goal is for the reader by the time the feel they want to leave the website.

 * Belligerents 
    - This is split into two seperate areas. One describes the Greek Allied forces, the other, the Achaemenid-Persian forces. Seperating both areas of content is a div of 3 images under each block of text. This is to give the reader a good idea of what a typical soldier looked like and how the armies may have fought together in groups. 
<!-- Screenshot -->

 * Battle Section 
    - The battle section, which is linked in the Navigation, splits up the information about the battle in to 3 day blocks. The reader can see what happened on each day of the battle, before viewing a battle map below to see where the battles took place and how the troops travelled to get there.
<!-- Screenshot -->

* Legacy Section
    - The Legacy section, which is linked in the Navigation, shows the immediate aftermath of the battle and the Cultural influences on us today. I want the user to see where certain famous phrases come from, and how this event in history has shaped modern media such as films, documentaries, books and games that the reader may recognise. 

    - If the reader doesn't recognise them, I hope it encourages the reader to investigate further into the media out of curiosity. 
<!-- Screenshot -->

* Footer/Social-Network Bar
    - This section, which is also linked in the Navigation Bar, encourages the reader to follow the developer on the displayed social media icons. They are very recognisable icons that should intuitively be clicked on to lead the reader to the given websites. 

<!-- Add screenshot of finished footer bar here -->

 ## Other Features to implement

 * In future, a link in the Nav bar to other related battles from the same period would be beneficial to the goals of the site and the reader, to give further context and detail to the battles referenced in my website. 

 * What I would do, is add a drop down link to the nav bar that contains links labelled by name of the battle (Marathon, Salamis, Plataea), and the reader would be taken to another page detailing that battle.
