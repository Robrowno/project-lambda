# Battle of Thermopylae Website - Project Lambda

Project Lambda is an informative history website focusing on the Battle of Thermopylae in 480BC.

The target audience for this website will be those looking to broaden there knowledge on Ancient Greek, or more specifically, Spartan history. 

My goal with this website is to engage with this target audience and anyone who will be interested in learning about the battle having heard of it in history lessons or films/documentaries, and want to learn more.

## My wireframe

I came up with my first wireframe and concept using the Balsamiq Wireframes Application that was suggested by Code Institute. 
This helped me to visualise my ideas and got me to think about how I might implement and style them. 

Using Balsamiq, I came up with three mediums for the website. A desktop, Tablet and Mobile rendering: 

### Desktop
