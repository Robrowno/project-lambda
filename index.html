        <h2>Context</h2>
          <p> Already by the start of the 5th century, the neighboring Persian Achaemenid Empire was experiencing an expansion into Europe. <br>
              King Darius I, the ruler of this vast Empire, had already subjugated Thrace and Macedonia. He had his sights set on the rest of the Greek world. <br> 
              It is important to remember that at this point in time, Greece was not a unified nation. In fact, it was a vassal of indeopendant city states that shared a similar culture. <br>
              Darius I was keen to incorporate these states under his rule. In 491 BC, he sent an envoy to the Greek city states demanding that they submit to his rule. <br>
              The Greeks refused, and Darius prepared an invasion force to take the Greek states the following year. 
                </p>
           <br>
          <p> In 490 BC, King Darius I sent a fleet of 600 ships and 25,000 men to attack Cyclades and Euboea, before meeting a combined Greek force led by Athens at the battle of Marathon. <br>
              This resulted in a decisive victory for the combined Greek fleet, halting Persian expansion into Greece. However, this would not be the end of the conflict. <br> 
              In 486 BC, King Darius I died, replaced by King Xerxes I. He planned to take revenge on the Greek states by ammassing the largest invasive force ever seen at the time. <br>
              This was to be the biggest threat to Greek independence yet, and would again required a collaborative effort between all states to fend off this bigger invasion. </p>
          <p> A greek spy notified officials within the key city of Sparta of the approaching Persian army, and whilst a plan was drawn up with other city states to send a force of 10,000 hoplites to fend off <br>
              the force at the Tempe Valley near Mt. Olympos, the festival of the Carneia made officials reluctant to go to war, as this was a celebration where military action was prohibited by Spartan Law. <br>
              The Olympic Games, held around the same time, meant other city states were reluctant to fight for a similar reason. </p>
            <br>
          <p> King Leonidas I of Sparta, could see the imminent threat to his city, and consulted with the ephors to negotiate sending a small task force to hold off the invasion. <br>
              They agreed on sending a 300-strong unit of the Spartan Royal Guard (Known as the Hippeis) with Leonidas. The goal, then, was to gather as many other greek soldiers along the way to defend a small pass on the east coast of Greece.
              This pass was known as The Hot Gates, or Thermopylae.
