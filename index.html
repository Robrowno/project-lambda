         <h2>About</h2>
           <p> Many historians have often wondered throughout the ages, how the course of history may have altered had certain events had a different outcome. <br> 
               If we want to delve back in time to a key event that has pathed the way to the rise of European civilizations as we know them, few events in history could have had a bigger impact on that than the battle of Thermopylae. <br> 
               This website will aim to show you the context and events leading up to the battle, and how it allowed the Greek world to continue to survive and pass on the cultural influences that still survive to this day. </p>

        <h2>Context</h2>
          <p> Already by the start of the 5th century, the neighboring Persian Achaemenid Empire was experiencing an expansion into Europe. <br>
              King Darius I, the ruler of this vast Empire, had already subjugated Thrace and Macedonia. He had his sights set on the rest of the Greek world. <br> 
              It is important to remember that at this point in time, Greece was not a unified nation. In fact, it was a vassal of indeopendant city states that shared a similar culture. <br>
              Darius I was keen to incorporate these states under his rule. In 491 BC, he sent an envoy to the Greek city states demanding that they submit to his rule. <br>
              The Greeks refused, and Darius prepared an invasion force to take the Greek states the following year. 
                </p>
           <br>
          <p> In 490 BC, King Darius I sent a fleet of 600 ships and 25,000 men to attack Cyclades and Euboea, before meeting a combined Greek force led by Athens at the battle of Marathon. <br>
              This resulted in a decisive victory for the combined Greek fleet, halting Persian expansion into Greece. However, this would not be the end of the conflict. <br> 
              In 486 BC, King Darius I died, replaced by King Xerxes I. He planned to take revenge on the Greek states by ammassing the largest invasive force ever seen at the time. <br>
              This was to be the biggest threat to Greek independence yet, and would again required a collaborative effort between all states to fend off this bigger invasion. </p>
          <p> A greek spy notified officials within the key city of Sparta of the approaching Persian army, and whilst a plan was drawn up with other city states to send a force of 10,000 hoplites to fend off <br>
              the force at the Tempe Valley near Mt. Olympos, the festival of the Carneia made officials reluctant to go to war, as this was a celebration where military action was prohibited by Spartan Law. <br>
              The Olympic Games, held around the same time, meant other city states were reluctant to fight for a similar reason. </p>
            <br>
          <p> King Leonidas I of Sparta, could see the imminent threat to his city, and consulted with the ephors to negotiate sending a small task force to hold off the invasion. <br>
              They agreed on sending a 300-strong unit of the Spartan Royal Guard (Known as the Hippeis) with Leonidas. The goal, then, was to gather as many other greek soldiers along the way to defend a small pass on the east coast of Greece.
              This pass was known as The Hot Gates, or Thermopylae. 
              In addition to the land defence, a naval blockade by the Athenian Navy was set up to prevent the Persian navy from out-flanking the Allied Greeks at Thermopylae. It was decided that the blockade would strong hold at Artemisium.

        <h2>Belligerents</h2>
          <p> The combined Greek force is estimated to have numbered at around 7000 troops. This mix of troops consited of Thebans, Thespians, Phocians, Arcadians, Mantineans, Tegeans, Corinthians, Mycenaeans and Phlians. <br>
              This combined force was entirely led under the command of King Leonidas I.  </p>

              <br>

          <p> The Persian army has had many varying estimates depending on different sources. However, modern day scholars estimate that the Persian army numbered anywhere between 12,000-300,000 strong. 
              Xerxes' army had an even wider variety of warriors from across his empire, including: Persians, Parthians, Bactrians, Zarangians, Scythians, Assyrians, Babylonians, Egyptions, Lydians and Ethiopians.

        <h2> Day 1</h2>
          <p>The Pass at Thermopylae was an great strategic positionf for the allied Greek army to hold their defense. To their left, steep mountains that ran down to the pass, and to the right was the Agean Sea. 
             The hoplite phalanx, a tight formation used by the Greeks, meant that in the narrow confines of Thermopylae, their inferior numbers mattered less as they could comfortably block the pass. 
             A wall was built to block a route around the defensive line to the Greek camp, and a band of Phocians were dispatched to defend an old goat path that lead form the Greek camp all the way to the Persian camp.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>The Persian emcampment had waiting for days prior before making their advance, expecting the Greeks to flee at the sight of the vast combined Persian force. 
             On the first day of the battle, after Xerxes grew impatient at waiting for the Greeks to retreat, he ordered his archers to fire a barrage of arrows at the Greek line. This was ineffective.
             Then, he ordered an assault on the Greek position with around 10,000 men to attempt to break their lines. The phalanx proved itself here, and in the tight-shielf formation, it successfully held off their advance. Greek units were rotated in and out of battle to prevent fatigue, showing they had plenty of men to hold the pass. 
          </p>
          <br> 
          <p>King Xerxes then ordered in his elite infanty, known as the Immortals. This was a unit consisting of 10,000 men at any one time, and got their name due to the fact that if any soldier fell, he was swiftly replaced. 
             The Immortals attacked, but had no more success than the previous wave. The Greeks successfully held off the Immortals with feigning retreats before quickly reorganising back into phalanx formation. 
          </p>
    
    </div>

    <div id="daytwo">
        <h2>Day 2</h2>
          <p> On day two, Xerxes sent in another vast assault again, hoping that by now the Greeks would be exhausted from the full day of fighting from the previous day. 
              They had made no progress on the previous day. The Greeks successfully held off wave after wave of Persian charge utilising the same tactics. It looked as though the Greeks would be able to keep this up for weeks if necessary. 
              However, a local shepherd from Thrachis was set to tip to balance in the Persians' favour. This man was Ephialtes, son of Eurydemos, and motivated by desire of wealth through Persian bribes, he went to the Persian camp to inform Xerxes and his commanders of the goat path that led to the Greek camp. </p>
              <br>
          <p> On the evening of day 2, Xerxes ordered one of his commanders, Hydarnes, to take a force of 20,000 with him and follow Ephialtes through the goat path. The path led from the east of the Persian camp along the edge of Mt. Anopaea, all the way behind the cliffs that flanked the pass at Thermopylae. The Persians, with the help of Ephialtes, saw that the path branches at on point, where one path lead to Phocis and the other to the Malian Gulf. They were sure that they could encircle the Greek army by the following day. They advanced through the night. 
         </p>
    </div>
          <div id="daythree">
            <h2>Day 3</h2>
              <p>At dawn, the Phocians guarding the goat path became aware of the approaching Persian army and hastily armed themselves. Both sides did not expect to come across each other. At first, Hydarnes hesitated to advance much further, fearing that the defending Greeks were Spartan. Ephialtes reassured him that they were not, and they pressed on. 
                 The Phocians, assuming themselves to be the target of the advancing army, withdrew to a higher position on a nearby hill to make a defensive stand. The Persians, seeing the gap in the pass, merely fired a volley of arrows at the defenders and carried on towards the allied Greek camp. 
                A runner alerted the Spartans command that the Phocians had not held the path, and King Leonidas summoned a war council immediately to discuss their next move.
                Many of the Greeks argued for an immediate withdrawal, as their position was now compromised and indefensible. Leonidas however, insisted the he and his fellow Spartans would stay and cover any Greeks that wished to retreat. They would hold the line no matter the cost. 
                Most took Leonidas up on this offer, fearing for their own lives and for the cities from which they came. However, a contingent of 700 Thespians, led by their general Demophilus, and a smaller group of 400 Thebans, chose to stand with the Spartans and fight to the end. </p> 
                <br>
               <p>At dawn, Xerxes made libations before ordering an assault on the Greek front lines. This wave consisted of 10,000 men, both light infantry and cavalry units. The Greeks broke rank and charged forward. When their spears broke, the went to their Xiphos (Greek short sword) and fought on even when their secondary weapons broke. In the struggle, two of Xerxes' own brothers were killed. 
                  Leonidas, too, fell in the battle to Persian archers. Both sides fought viciously to reclaim his body. When Xerxes ordered in his 'Immortals', the Greeks withdrew to a hill behind the wall they had built to hold a last-stand. 
                  <br>
                  The Persian army began tearing down the wall, and Xerxes ordered the hill defenders to be completely surrounded. He ordered his archers to fire until all Greeks were killed. 
                  The Persian army then advanced on, as the pass at Thermopylae was now cleared of defenders.

        <h2>Aftermath</h2>
          <p>In the direct aftermath of the battle, the Persian army could now carry on its advance into the rest of Greece and rendered the Athenian naval blockade of Artemisium irrelevant. Furthermore, the resulting battle of Artemisium resulted in a tactical stalemate, and forced the Greek navy to withdraw to the island of Salamis.
             Following Thermopylae, the Persians proceeded to sack Plataea, Thespiae and any Boeotian cities that would not submit to Persian rule. 
             Athens was evacuated and the Persian Army proceeded to sack Athens as well, which was an event that was known as the Achaemenid destruction of Athens. 
             A Greek allied army began a defense of the Isthmus of Corinth, and demolished a single track to it and constructed a large wall, similar to what was done at Thermopylae. 
             As with Thermopylae, a naval blockade was planned to hold off any flanking from the Persian Navy. The Athenian general Themistocles, persuaded the Allied Greeks that a decisive naval victory was needed at the site of the blockade. 
             Luring the Persian Navy into the Straits of Salamis, the Greek Fleet was able to destroy much of the enemy fleet in what became known as the Battle of Salamis. </p>
             <br>
          <p> Xerxes ordered a general retreat back into Asia, fearing further destruction from the Greeks, but ordered that an invasive force return the following year to attemptto complete the Hellenic conquest. 
              After a series of failed political negotiations, the two opposing forces met at Plataea, and initiated the battle of Plataea, in which the Allied Greeks boasted the biggest hoplite army ever assembled. 
              This battle resulted in a decisive Greek victory and ending the Persian threat to the Greeks.

        <h2>Cultural Influence</h2>
          <p> <!---A paragraph with info on cultural influence, such as monuments, art, legends and media. --->
            In the Ancient Greek world, the battle of Thermopylae served as a morale lesson to its people. One where duty to one's strongly held beliefs and values, even in the face of death, are worth fighting and paying the ultimate price for. 
            Today in the contemporary world, the same message echoes through time. A smaller, free people standing up to a much greater foe in uncertain odds and uncertain outcomes inspires many to this day. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <p> 
            Several monuments have been built to celebrate the heroic deeds of the Soldiers at Thermopylae. The most famous is the statue of Leonidas, the Leonidas Monument by Vassos Felireas.
            Depicted under the statue of the Spartan King, is the phrase "Molon Labe" - meaning "Come and take them". This phrase will be explained further below.
